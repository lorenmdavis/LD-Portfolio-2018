----------------------- To-Do -----------------------

- Your site needs to be submitted as a zipped file but it also needs to be hosted on the web. You will need to provide a URL as well as all of the necessary files.

- Provide a statement of purpose, talk about your process, what worked, what didn't. Are you satisfied with the results? What would you like to incorporate in the future? In your statement of purpose cite where you incorporate JavaScript and why it was beneficial, as well as where you used CSS animations. Discuss how your site checks out using a site optimizer. Your statement of purpose should be at least 10 sentences.

- Portfolio presentation, present your website, you need to show your site 'live' on the internet.

----------------------- Done -----------------------
- All code validates
- Responsive
- Use SASS for your CSS, make sure to minify all files for the final publication but please include all un-minified files. Make sure to use partials, variables, mixins and calculations where applicable.
- Use CSS3 animations on your website, think about what would enhance your website, what sorts of things can CSS do better than another solution.
- All images and materials are optimized.
- Use some JavaScript to enhance the end user experience, think about what is something you want to accomplish that is best handled by js. You can use jQuery or another js library if that makes the most sense.
- Consider design, make sure to utilize the principles and elements of design to ensure that your content is easy to view and pleasant
