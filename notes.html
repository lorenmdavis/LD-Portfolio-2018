- Use SASS for your CSS, make sure to minify all files for the final publication but please include all un-minified files. Make sure to use partials, variables, mixins and calculations where applicable.

- Use CSS3 animations on your website, think about what would enhance your website, what sorts of things can CSS do better than another solution.
    --Nav rollovers
